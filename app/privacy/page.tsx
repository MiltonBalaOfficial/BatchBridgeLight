              This Privacy Policy describes how BatchBridge ("we", "us", or
              "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information in
              connection with your use of our website and services (the
              "Services").
            </p>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
              We may collect personal information from you, such as your name,
              email address, batch, college, and other information you provide
              when you register for and use our Services. We may also collect
              information about your use of the Services, such as the pages you
              view and the actions you take.
            </p>
            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>
              We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and
              improve our Services, to communicate with you, and to personalize
              your experience. We may also use your information to comply with
              legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>
              We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties
              your personally identifiable information. This does not include
              trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website,
              conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those
              parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also
              release your information when we believe release is appropriate to
              comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or
              others' rights, property, or safety.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information
              from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method
              of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
              storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
              commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
              information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You
              acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
            </p>
            <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
            <p>
              You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable
              information through the Services, in which case we may not be able
              to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your
              account information and email preferences at any time by logging
              in to your account.
            </p>
            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will
              notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
              this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
              periodically for any changes.
